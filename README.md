# GPT-FROM-SCRATCH
### Overview
The GPT-2 Model Generator is a sophisticated text generation system built from scratch using PyTorch. This project encompasses the complete process of designing and implementing a GPT-2 model, including data preprocessing, model training, and text generation. The system uses a character-level vocabulary to generate coherent and contextually relevant text based on user input.

### Features
The project involved creating a custom GPT-2 model that incorporates embedding, self-attention, and feed-forward layers. It included the development of a character-level vocabulary and the preprocessing of text data. A training loop with detailed logging was implemented to monitor the model's performance, and text generation was facilitated through temperature and top-k sampling techniques to ensure diverse outputs. Additionally, an interactive Jupyter notebook was developed to provide an intuitive interface for experimentation, fine-tuning, and testing of the GPT-2 model.
